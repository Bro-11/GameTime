How to Update Your Game

There are two methods: 
1. Submit an update request through the shortcut. 
Same as submitting a game but it gets a higher priority in my inbox. 
All required fields must be filled out. 

2. Create a pull request on your game with the  following information: 
* New version number
* Shorcut URL
* (Optional) Patch Notes

Please note that you can only change your own games.
