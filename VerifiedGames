Verified Games and Unverified Games

* A game being on the official GameTime store means it is verified. When a game has verified status, it means I have checked the shortcut and have found it free of malicious content and a fun game overall.  
* Verified status means the game has been checked. However, unverified games may not be malicious and may be fun games. Just because a game isn't verified, it doesn't mean it is a bad or malicious shortcut.

If you find a verified game to contain malicious content, submit feedback through the settings section in the shortcut.  
Likewise, if you find an unverified game to be a good, non malicious game in itself, feel free to let me know about it in feedback.
