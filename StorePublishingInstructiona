Publishing Games to the GameTime Store

Create a pull request creating a new file with the following information: 

1. Name of game
2. Version of game
3. URL of shortcut
4. (Optional) Price of game

I'll review the request and add it if: 
1. Non-malicious
2. Reasonably priced
3. Is a game
4. Shortcut name starts with GT- (This is to differentiate from other shortcuts an this is how GameTime detects your games.)
