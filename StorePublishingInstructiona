Publishing Games to the GameTime Store

There are two methods: 
1. Submit your game through the shortcut in the developer menu. 
It will ask you for all required fields. 

2. Create an issue with the following information: 

1. Name of game
2. Version of game
3. URL of shortcut


I'll review the request and add it if: 
1. Non-malicious
2. Is a game
